# My Books
> The books I've read

This repo is a list of the thoughts I've had about the books I've read. Those
thoughts are searchable via the website, and the thoughts are gathered from this
repo's issues.

## Getting started

Visit the live website:

https://books.thejunkland.com


## Developing

This project is a fairly standard static next.js site. To run it locally:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will install the dependencies start a local server at http://localhost:3000.

### Building

To build the site for production:

```shell
npm run build
```

This will build the site and output the static files to the `out` directory.

### Deploying

This project is deployed automagically to Github Pages via Github Actions.

## Features

This is an awesome site that:
* I can create these issues straight from my phone while I'm reading the book
* You probably don't need to use this, since it's more for my own reference
* Has a fairly good fuzzy search

## Contributing

This project is pretty much my own personal project for my own use. If you feel
the need, please open an issue and we can discuss it.

## Licensing
